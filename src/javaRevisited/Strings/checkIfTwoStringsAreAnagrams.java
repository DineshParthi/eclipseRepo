   /*
    * Same as the questions of checking if two Strings are palindrome's of each other
    * Method-1: 
    * Sort the Strings and iterate from start to end comparing each character.
    * Method-2: 
    * Note that in order for two strings to be anagrams, their count of characters has to be the same.
    * Use a hash map to store the counts. Increment map values for string-1 and decrement the map values for string-2
    * Iterate over the map values and return 'false' if any value is >0 or 'true' otherwise
    * Note: If the strings are of unequal length, immediately return false
    * If the string is empty or null, return true.
